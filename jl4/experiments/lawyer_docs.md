# **L4: A Learning Guide for Legal Professionals**

## **Introduction**

L4 is a programming language designed specifically for translating legal documents into precise, executable code. This guide will take you step-by-step from writing your first legal rule to modeling complete regulatory schemes like the Jersey Charities Law.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to write legal rules that a computer can understand and execute
- How to model complex legal relationships and processes
- How to test and simulate legal scenarios
- How to organize and maintain large bodies of legislation

**Prerequisites:** 
- Basic familiarity with legal concepts
- No programming experience required (we'll teach you what you need)

# **Part 1: Your First Legal Rule**

Let's start with something every lawyer understands: a simple legal obligation.

## **1.1 A Single Legal Obligation**

**Example:** "A registered charity must file an annual return."

In L4, we need to first set up the basic types and structure:

```l4
IMPORT prelude

-- Define basic types first
DECLARE RegisteredCharity
    HAS name IS A STRING
        registrationNumber IS A STRING
        isRegistered IS A BOOLEAN

DECLARE Actor IS ONE OF
    CharityActor HAS charity IS A RegisteredCharity

DECLARE Action IS ONE OF
    FileAnnualReturn

-- Now we can write the legal obligation
GIVEN charity IS A RegisteredCharity
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`charity annual return obligation` MEANS
  PARTY CharityActor charity
  MUST FileAnnualReturn
  WITHIN 365
  HENCE FULFILLED
```

Let's break this down:
- `IMPORT prelude` - Imports basic L4 functions
- `DECLARE` statements - Define the types we'll use
- `GIVEN charity IS A RegisteredCharity` - This rule applies to registered charities
- `GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action` - This function returns a contract
- `PARTY CharityActor charity` - The charity is the one with the obligation  
- `MUST FileAnnualReturn` - This is what they must do
- `WITHIN 365` - They have 365 days
- `HENCE FULFILLED` - What happens when they comply

**Try it yourself:** Write a rule that says "A solicitor must maintain client confidentiality."

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```l4
DECLARE Solicitor
    HAS name IS A STRING
        licenseNumber IS A STRING

DECLARE Actor IS ONE OF
    SolicitorActor HAS solicitor IS A Solicitor

DECLARE Action IS ONE OF
    MaintainConfidentiality

GIVEN solicitor IS A Solicitor
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`solicitor confidentiality obligation` MEANS
  PARTY SolicitorActor solicitor
  MUST MaintainConfidentiality
  WITHIN 365
  HENCE FULFILLED
```
</details>

## **1.2 Adding Conditions and Consequences**

Real legal rules have conditions and consequences. Let's make our charity rule more realistic:

```l4
GIVEN charity IS A RegisteredCharity
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`charity conditional return obligation` MEANS
  IF charity's isRegistered EQUALS TRUE
  THEN PARTY CharityActor charity
       MUST FileAnnualReturn
       WITHIN 60  -- 2 months in days
       HENCE FULFILLED
       LEST FULFILLED
  ELSE FULFILLED
```

New elements:
- `IF charity's isRegistered EQUALS TRUE` - Adds a condition using proper boolean comparison
- `WITHIN 60` - Sets a deadline (60 days = approximately 2 months)
- `HENCE FULFILLED` - What happens if they comply
- `LEST FULFILLED` - What happens if they don't comply
- `ELSE FULFILLED` - Alternative path if condition not met

**The Legal Logic:** This captures the complete legal structure: who, what, when, and consequences.

## **1.3 Your First Simulation**

Let's test our rule with some data:

```l4
-- Define Date type first
DECLARE Date
    HAS year IS A NUMBER
        month IS A NUMBER
        day IS A NUMBER

-- Define Purpose type
DECLARE Purpose IS ONE OF
    `advancement of animal welfare`
    `advancement of education`

-- Update RegisteredCharity with all needed fields
DECLARE RegisteredCharity
    HAS name IS A STRING
        registrationNumber IS A STRING
        registrationDate IS A Date
        address IS A STRING
        purposes IS A LIST OF Purpose
        isRegistered IS A BOOLEAN

-- Create a test charity
DECIDE testCharity IS RegisteredCharity "Animal Welfare Society" "CH001" (Date 2020 1 15) "Jersey" (LIST `advancement of animal welfare`) TRUE

-- The charity now exists and can be used in rules
```

**What This Does:** We can now create specific charity instances and test our rules against them.

**Success Check:** You can now write a basic legal obligation, add conditions and deadlines, and test it with data.

---

# **Part 2: Legal Entities and Relationships**

## **2.1 From Strings to Structured Types**

**Problem:** Using simple text leads to errors and ambiguity.

**Bad approach:**
```l4
-- charity MEANS "Some Charity Name"  -- Just text, no structure
```

**Better approach - Structured Types:**
```l4
DECLARE RegisteredCharity
    HAS name IS A STRING
        registrationNumber IS A STRING  
        registrationDate IS A Date
        address IS A STRING
        purposes IS A LIST OF Purpose
        isRegistered IS A BOOLEAN
```

**Why This Matters:**
- **Prevents errors:** Can't accidentally use a person where you need a charity
- **Captures relationships:** Links charities to their purposes, addresses, etc.
- **Enables validation:** L4 can check if all required information is present

**Example:**
```l4
DECIDE animalCharity IS RegisteredCharity "Jersey Animal Welfare" "CH001" (Date 2020 1 15) "St. Helier, Jersey" (LIST `advancement of animal welfare`) TRUE
```

## **2.2 Enumerating Legal Categories**

**Legal Insight:** Law often provides specific lists and categories.

Instead of treating charitable purposes as free text:
```l4
-- purposes IS A LIST OF STRING  -- Allows typos and inconsistencies
```

Use precise legal categories:
```l4
DECLARE Purpose IS ONE OF
    `prevention or relief of poverty`
    `advancement of education` 
    `advancement of religion`
    `advancement of health`
    `advancement of animal welfare`
    otherPurpose HAS description IS A STRING  -- For edge cases
```

**Benefits:**
- **Matches legal structure:** Mirrors how legislation actually defines categories
- **Prevents typos:** Can't accidentally write "education advancement" instead of "advancement of education"
- **Enables legal tests:** Can easily check if all purposes are charitable

**Pattern matching with legal categories:**
```l4
GIVEN p IS A Purpose
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
`is charitable purpose` MEANS
    CONSIDER p
    WHEN `advancement of education` THEN TRUE
    WHEN `advancement of animal welfare` THEN TRUE
    WHEN `prevention or relief of poverty` THEN TRUE
    WHEN otherPurpose s THEN `is analogous to charitable purpose` p
    OTHERWISE FALSE

-- Helper function for the pattern matching
GIVEN p IS A Purpose
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
`is analogous to charitable purpose` MEANS
    CONSIDER p
    WHEN otherPurpose desc THEN TRUE  -- Simplified for now
    OTHERWISE FALSE
```

## **2.3 Connecting Multiple Entities**

Legal systems involve relationships between multiple entities:

```l4
DECLARE Person
    HAS name IS A STRING
        address IS A STRING
        isGovernor IS A BOOLEAN

DECLARE RegisteredCharity  
    HAS name IS A STRING
        registrationNumber IS A STRING
        registrationDate IS A Date
        governors IS A LIST OF Person  -- Relationship to people
        address IS A STRING
        purposes IS A LIST OF Purpose  -- Relationship to purposes
        isRegistered IS A BOOLEAN
```

**Real legal rule using relationships:**
```l4
DECLARE Actor IS ONE OF
    PersonActor HAS person IS A Person

DECLARE Action IS ONE OF
    ActInBestInterests HAS description IS A STRING

GIVEN governor IS A Person
      charity IS A RegisteredCharity
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`governor fiduciary obligation` MEANS
  IF governor's isGovernor EQUALS TRUE AND elem governor (charity's governors)
  THEN PARTY PersonActor governor
       MUST ActInBestInterests "act in best interests of charity and beneficiaries"
       WITHIN 365
       HENCE FULFILLED
  ELSE FULFILLED
```

**Success Check:** You can now model structured legal entities, use proper legal categories, and express relationships between entities.

---

# **Part 3: Multi-Step Legal Processes**

## **3.1 Beyond Single Rules: The CONTRACT Approach**

**Problem:** Real legal processes involve multiple connected steps, not isolated rules.

**Example Process:** Charity registration involves application → assessment → decision → registration → ongoing compliance.

**Traditional approach (limited):**
```l4
-- These would be disconnected rules that don't connect to each other
-- PARTY applicant MUST `submit application`
-- PARTY Commissioner MUST `assess application`  
-- PARTY Commissioner MUST `make decision`
```

**CONTRACT approach (powerful):**
```l4
DECLARE CharityApplication
    HAS applicantName IS A STRING
        purposes IS A LIST OF Purpose
        constitution IS A STRING

DECLARE Actor IS ONE OF
    ApplicantActor HAS application IS A CharityApplication
    CommissionerActor

DECLARE Action IS ONE OF
    ProvideApplication HAS contents IS A STRING
    AssessApplication HAS application IS A STRING

GIVEN applicant IS A CharityApplication
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`registration process` MEANS
  PARTY ApplicantActor applicant
  MUST ProvideApplication "complete application documents"
  WITHIN 30  -- reasonable time
  HENCE FULFILLED  -- This would connect to assessment in a full system
  LEST FULFILLED   -- Application incomplete
```

**Key insight:** Real legal processes involve connected steps that can be modeled as contracts.

## **3.2 Actor/Action Patterns**

**Structure who can do what:**

```l4
DECLARE Actor IS ONE OF
   CharityActor HAS charity IS A RegisteredCharity
   PersonActor HAS person IS A Person
   CommissionerActor  -- Regulatory authority
   ApplicantActor HAS application IS A CharityApplication

DECLARE Action IS ONE OF
   ProvideApplication HAS contents IS A STRING
   AssessApplication HAS application IS A STRING
   RegisterCharity HAS charity IS A RegisteredCharity
   IssueNotice HAS notice IS A STRING
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Legal precision:** Matches how law defines roles and powers
- **Prevents errors:** A charity can't issue regulatory notices
- **Clear authority:** Shows who has power to do what

**Example using structured actors/actions:**
```l4
GIVEN application IS A STRING
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`registration assessment` MEANS
  PARTY CommissionerActor
  MUST AssessApplication application
  WITHIN 28  -- days
  HENCE FULFILLED  -- Would connect to registration decision
  LEST FULFILLED   -- Refuse registration with reasons
```

## **3.3 State Changes and Register Events**

**Legal processes change official records.** We need to model how actions update the register:

```l4
DECLARE CharityRegister
    HAS activeCharities IS A LIST OF RegisteredCharity
        historicCharities IS A LIST OF RegisteredCharity
        lastUpdated IS A Date

-- Show how registration changes the register (as a function)
GIVEN newCharity IS A RegisteredCharity
      register IS A CharityRegister
      date IS A Date
GIVETH A CharityRegister
`add charity to register` MEANS
    CharityRegister (register's activeCharities) (register's historicCharities) date
    -- Note: This is simplified - real implementation would add newCharity to the list
```

**Complete process with state changes:**
```l4
DECLARE Action IS ONE OF
   RegisterCharity HAS charity IS A RegisteredCharity
   UpdateRegister HAS newRegister IS A CharityRegister

GIVEN newCharity IS A RegisteredCharity
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`complete registration` MEANS
  PARTY CommissionerActor
  MUST RegisterCharity newCharity
  WITHIN 10  -- days to complete registration
  HENCE FULFILLED  -- Registration completed
  LEST FULFILLED   -- Registration failed
```

**Success Check:** You can now model connected legal processes, structured authority relationships, and state changes to official records.

# **Part 4: Real Regulatory Scheme - Jersey Charities Law**

Now we'll build a complete model of real legislation step by step.

## **4.1 The Three Layers Architecture**

**Real legislation has three types of provisions:**

1. **Structural/Interpretive Layer:** Definitions, institutions, basic concepts
2. **Deontic Rules Layer:** Obligations, powers, prohibitions  
3. **Register/State-Transition Layer:** How actions change official records

**Jersey Charities Example:**

**Layer 1 - Structural:**
```l4
IMPORT prelude

-- Basic definitions (Art 1-2)
DECLARE Purpose IS ONE OF
    `prevention or relief of poverty`
    `advancement of education`
    `advancement of religion`
    `advancement of health`
    `advancement of animal welfare`
    -- Additional statutory purposes would go here

-- Date type for official records
DECLARE Date
    HAS year IS A NUMBER
        month IS A NUMBER
        day IS A NUMBER

-- Institutions (Art 3-4)  
DECLARE Commissioner
    HAS name IS A STRING

DECLARE CharityRegister
    HAS activeCharities IS A LIST OF RegisteredCharity
        lastUpdated IS A Date
```

**Layer 2 - Deontic Rules:**
```l4
-- Annual return obligation (Art 13)
DECLARE Actor IS ONE OF
    CharityActor HAS charity IS A RegisteredCharity

DECLARE Action IS ONE OF
    FileReturn HAS financialData IS A STRING

DECLARE RegisteredCharity
    HAS name IS A STRING
        registrationNumber IS A STRING
        purposes IS A LIST OF Purpose
        isActive IS A BOOLEAN

GIVEN charity IS A RegisteredCharity
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`annual return process` MEANS
  PARTY CharityActor charity
  MUST FileReturn "financial data"
  WITHIN 60  -- 2 months in days
  HENCE FULFILLED  -- transparency maintained
  LEST FULFILLED   -- Commissioner may issue Required Steps Notice
```

**Layer 3 - Register Events:**
```l4
-- How filing updates the register
DECLARE RegisterAction IS ONE OF
    AnnualReturnLogged HAS charity IS A RegisteredCharity
                          date IS A Date
```

## **4.2 Building Your Register**

**Start with an empty register:**
```l4
DECIDE emptyRegister IS CharityRegister (LIST) (Date 2024 1 1)
```

**Add registration process:**
```l4
DECLARE Actor IS ONE OF
    ApplicantActor HAS name IS A STRING
    CommissionerActor

DECLARE Action IS ONE OF
    ProvideApplication HAS documents IS A STRING

GIVEN applicant IS A STRING
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`registration process` MEANS
  PARTY ApplicantActor applicant
  MUST ProvideApplication "required documents"
  WITHIN 30  -- reasonable time
  HENCE FULFILLED  -- Commissioner assessment process
  LEST FULFILLED   -- Application incomplete
```

## **4.3 Enforcement and Sanctions**

**Real law includes enforcement mechanisms:**

```l4
DECLARE Action IS ONE OF
    SuspendGovernor HAS governor IS A STRING
                        reason IS A STRING
    IssueNotice HAS steps IS A STRING

-- Governor misconduct (Art 19-20)
GIVEN misconductDetected IS A BOOLEAN
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`misconduct response` MEANS
  IF misconductDetected EQUALS TRUE
  THEN PARTY CommissionerActor
       MUST SuspendGovernor "governor name" "misconduct reason"
       WITHIN 14  -- days
       HENCE FULFILLED  -- disciplinary action recorded
       LEST FULFILLED   -- misconduct unaddressed
  ELSE FULFILLED

-- Required Steps Notice (Art 27)
GIVEN complianceFailure IS A BOOLEAN
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`enforcement escalation` MEANS
  IF complianceFailure EQUALS TRUE
  THEN PARTY CommissionerActor
       MUST IssueNotice "required steps and deadline"
       WITHIN 7  -- days
       HENCE FULFILLED  -- charity must comply or face deregistration
       LEST FULFILLED   -- enforcement action required
  ELSE FULFILLED
```

**Success Check:** You have modeled a complete regulatory scheme with registration, ongoing compliance, enforcement, and deregistration.

---

# **Part 5: Understanding the Why**

## **5.1 Why Type Safety Matters for Law**

**The Problem:** Legal drafting often suffers from ambiguity and inconsistency.

**Example ambiguity:**
> "The charity must notify the person responsible within 30 days."

**Questions arise:**
- Which person? The governor? The secretary? The Commissioner?
- 30 days from what event?
- What form should the notification take?

**L4's type safety prevents these problems:**

```l4
DECLARE NotificationTarget IS ONE OF
    Governor HAS name IS A STRING
    Commissioner
    Secretary HAS name IS A STRING

DECLARE NotificationEvent IS ONE OF  
    GovernorAppointment HAS date IS A Date
    ConvictionReported HAS convictionDate IS A Date
    AddressChange HAS changeDate IS A Date

DECLARE Actor IS ONE OF
    CharityActor HAS charity IS A RegisteredCharity

DECLARE Action IS ONE OF
    NotifyPerson HAS target IS A NotificationTarget
                     content IS A STRING

GIVEN charity IS A RegisteredCharity
      notificationContent IS A STRING
      event IS A NotificationEvent
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`notification obligation` MEANS
  PARTY CharityActor charity
  MUST NotifyPerson Commissioner notificationContent
  WITHIN 30  -- days from event date
  HENCE FULFILLED
  LEST FULFILLED
```

**Benefits:**
- **Eliminates ambiguity:** Exactly which person, exactly which event
- **Prevents inconsistency:** Can't accidentally use wrong notification type
- **Enables automation:** Computer can check compliance automatically

## **5.2 Why CONTRACT Over Simple Rules**

**Traditional legal drafting:** Each section states an isolated obligation.

**Problem:** Real legal processes are interconnected workflows, not isolated duties.

**Example - Annual Return Process:**
- Art 13(7): Charity must file return
- Art 13(8): Commissioner must publish data  
- Art 27(1): Commissioner may issue Required Steps Notice for non-compliance
- Art 16(1): Commissioner may deregister for continued non-compliance

**These are connected steps in a process, not separate obligations.**

**CONTRACT approach captures the connections:**

```l4
DECLARE Actor IS ONE OF
    CharityActor HAS charity IS A RegisteredCharity
    CommissionerActor

DECLARE Action IS ONE OF
    FileReturn HAS financials IS A STRING
    PublishData HAS data IS A STRING
    IssueRequiredStepsNotice HAS steps IS A STRING
    InitiateDeregistration HAS grounds IS A STRING

GIVEN charity IS A RegisteredCharity
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`annual return workflow` MEANS
  PARTY CharityActor charity
  MUST FileReturn "financial data"
  WITHIN 60  -- 2 months
  HENCE FULFILLED  -- Commissioner publishes data AND compliance maintained
  LEST FULFILLED   -- Commissioner empowered to issue Required Steps Notice
```

**Benefits:**
- **Captures legal reality:** Shows how legal processes actually work
- **Enables simulation:** Can test complete workflows, not just isolated rules
- **Supports drafting:** Reveals gaps and inconsistencies in legal design

## **5.3 Why Modular Architecture Works**

**Legal reality:** Modern regulation involves primary law + multiple subsidiary instruments.

**Jersey Charities Example:**
- **Primary Law:** Charities (Jersey) Law 2014
- **Core Financial Info Regs 2018:** Defines financial reporting requirements
- **Additional Info Order 2018:** Adds governor payment reporting
- **Timing Order 2019:** Sets annual return deadlines
- **Reasons and Time Limits Order 2020:** Appeals procedures

**L4 modular approach:**

```l4
-- Main legislation file  
IMPORT prelude
-- IMPORT `charities-types`     -- Shared definitions (when modules are available)
-- IMPORT `annual-returns`      -- Specific processes (when modules are available)

-- For now, define everything in one file:
DECLARE RegisteredCharity
    HAS name IS A STRING
        registrationNumber IS A STRING
        -- other fields

DECLARE FinancialData
    HAS coreInfo IS A STRING
        governorPayments IS A STRING
        publicBenefitNarrative IS A STRING

-- Annual Return Process (integrating multiple orders)
GIVEN charity IS A RegisteredCharity
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`comprehensive annual return` MEANS
  PARTY CharityActor charity
  MUST FileReturn "integrated financial data"  -- All 4 instruments
  WITHIN 60  -- Timing Order 2019: 2 months
  HENCE FULFILLED  -- Full transparency achieved (Purpose of Art 13 Law 2014)
  LEST FULFILLED   -- Late flag set + Required Steps Notice enabled
```

**Benefits:**
- **Mirrors legal structure:** Matches how law is actually organized
- **Supports collaboration:** Different teams can work on different modules (when available)
- **Enables updates:** Can amend subsidiary regulations without changing primary law
- **Reduces complexity:** Each file focuses on its specific domain

## **5.4 Common Patterns in Regulatory Law**

**Recognition Patterns** (registration, licensing):
- Application → Assessment → Decision → Registration → Ongoing compliance

**Ongoing Compliance Patterns** (reporting, inspection):
- Periodic obligations → Monitoring → Non-compliance → Enforcement → Resolution

**Enforcement Patterns** (sanctions, appeals):
- Detection → Investigation → Decision → Sanction → Appeal → Final resolution

**These patterns appear across different regulatory domains** (charities, financial services, professional regulation, etc.)

**L4 captures these patterns consistently:**

```l4
-- Generic enforcement pattern
DECLARE EnforcementAction IS ONE OF
    Warning HAS issueDate IS A Date
    Fine HAS amount IS A Money
    Suspension HAS period IS A Duration  
    Revocation HAS effectiveDate IS A Date
```

---

# **Part 6: Advanced Techniques** 

## **6.1 Cross-Cutting Concerns**

**Problem:** Some legal concepts (like appeals) apply across multiple processes.

**Example:** Appeals can be made against:
- Registration refusal (Art 33)
- Required Steps Notice (Art 33)  
- Deregistration decision (Art 33)
- Name change refusal (Art 33)

**Solution - Generic appeal mechanism:**

```l4
DECLARE AppealableDecision IS ONE OF
    RegistrationRefusal HAS reasons IS A LIST OF STRING
    RequiredStepsNotice HAS steps IS A LIST OF STRING
    DeregistrationDecision HAS grounds IS A LIST OF STRING
    NameChangeRefusal HAS reasons IS A LIST OF STRING

§ `Universal Appeal Right (Art 33)`
GIVEN decision IS AN AppealableDecision
GIVETH A PROVISION Actor Action  
`appeal process` MEANS
  PARTY AffectedParty
  MAY AppealDecision OF decision
  WITHIN 28 days OF `decision notice served`
  HENCE `appeal proceeds to tribunal`
  LEST `appeal time expired`
```

## **6.2 Multi-Instrument Integration**

**Real example - Annual Return Requirements:**

Combines requirements from 4 different instruments:
- **Art 13(7)-(10) Law 2014:** Basic obligation
- **Core Info Regs 2018:** Financial data requirements  
- **Additional Info Order 2018:** Governor payment details
- **Timing Order 2019:** Deadline specifications

**L4 integration approach:**

**Step 1:** Define the complex data structure outside the PROVISION:
```l4
-- Define integrated financial data structure first
integratedFinancialData MEANS IntegratedFinancialData WITH
         coreFinancialInfo IS TRUE,      -- Core Info Regs 2018
         governorPayments IS TRUE,       -- Additional Info Order 2018
         publicBenefitNarrative IS TRUE  -- Additional Info Order 2018
```

**Step 2:** Reference it in the PROVISION rule:
```l4
§ `Integrated Annual Return (4 instruments)`
GIVETH A PROVISION Actor Action
`comprehensive annual return` MEANS
  PARTY RegisteredCharity
  MUST FileReturn OF integratedFinancialData
  WITHIN 2 months OF `financial year end`  -- Timing Order 2019
  HENCE `full transparency achieved`        -- Purpose of Art 13 Law 2014
  LEST `lateFlag set + Required Steps Notice enabled`
```

**Key insight:** Keep PROVISION actions simple by pre-defining complex objects rather than constructing them inline.

## **6.2a PROVISION Syntax Best Practices**

**Critical Rule:** Avoid complex object construction within PROVISION rules.

**❌ Problematic (causes syntax errors):**
```l4
PARTY applicant
MUST ProvideApplication OF ApplicationContents WITH
       constitution IS applicant's constitution,
       purposes IS applicant's purposes,
       coreFinancialInfo IS CoreFinancialInfo WITH
         income IS Money OF 0 "GBP",
         expenditure IS Money OF 0 "GBP"
```

**✅ Correct approach - Use helper functions:**
```l4
-- Define helper function outside PROVISION
GIVEN applicant IS A RegisterEntry
GIVETH AN ApplicationContents
DECIDE `build application contents` IS
  ApplicationContents WITH
    constitution IS applicant's constitution,
    purposes IS applicant's purposes,
    coreFinancialInfo IS CoreFinancialInfo WITH
      income IS Money OF 0 "GBP",
      expenditure IS Money OF 0 "GBP"

-- Use simple reference in PROVISION
PARTY applicant
MUST ProvideApplication OF `build application contents` applicant
```

**✅ Alternative - Pre-define examples:**
```l4
-- Define complete example outside PROVISION
exampleApplication MEANS ApplicationContents WITH
    constitution IS standardConstitution,
    purposes IS LIST `advancement of education`,
    coreFinancialInfo IS standardFinancials

-- Reference directly in PROVISION
PARTY applicant
MUST ProvideApplication OF exampleApplication
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Syntax requirements:** L4 parser expects simple expressions in PROVISION actions
- **Readability:** Complex object construction clutters the legal logic
- **Maintainability:** Helper functions can be reused across multiple PROVISION rules
- **Testing:** Pre-defined objects are easier to validate and test

**Pattern for actions with structured data:**
1. **Define the structure** using `DECLARE`
2. **Create helper functions** or examples using `DECIDE` or `MEANS`
3. **Use simple references** in PROVISION rules
4. **Keep legal logic clean** and focus on the process flow

## **6.3 Advanced Simulations**

**Multi-party scenario with error handling:**

```l4
#PROVISION `Complex Misconduct Scenario` charity Commissioner governor tribunal AT 1 WITH
  -- Discovery phase
  PARTY Commissioner DOES `discover potential misconduct` governor AT 10
  PARTY Commissioner DOES `investigate allegations` AT 20
  
  -- Decision phase  
  PARTY Commissioner DOES SuspendGovernor OF governor, "mismanagement", (Date OF 2024, 12, 31) AT 30
  
  -- Charity response (may fail)
  PARTY charity DOES `attempt to ignore suspension` AT 40  -- Error condition
  PARTY Commissioner DOES `detect non-compliance by charity` AT 50
  
  -- Escalation
  PARTY Commissioner DOES IssueNotice OF requiredSteps AT 60
  PARTY charity DOES `comply with required steps` AT 70
  
  -- Appeal
  PARTY governor DOES AppealDecision OF suspensionOrder AT 80
  PARTY tribunal DOES `hear appeal and vary order` AT 120
  
  -- Resolution
  PARTY Commissioner DOES VaryOrder OF originalSuspension, newConditions AT 130
```

**Performance considerations for large schemes:**

```l4
-- Efficient register lookups
ASSUME `charity by registration number` IS A FUNCTION FROM STRING TO MAYBE RegisteredCharity
ASSUME `active governors for charity` IS A FUNCTION FROM STRING TO LIST OF Person

-- Bulk operations for large datasets
DECLARE BulkAction IS ONE OF
    BulkAnnualReturnReminder HAS charities IS A LIST OF STRING
    BulkComplianceCheck HAS cutoffDate IS A Date
```

**Success Check:** You can now handle cross-cutting legal concerns, integrate multiple legal instruments, and create sophisticated simulations with error handling and performance considerations.

# **Part 7: L4 Syntax Mastery - Functional Programming for Lawyers**

## **7.1 The Functional Mindset: "Think More in a Haskell Way"**

**Critical insight:** L4 is fundamentally a functional programming language. Understanding this is essential for writing correct L4 code.

**What does "functional" mean for lawyers?**

1. **Functions over procedures:** Instead of step-by-step instructions, you define what something IS
2. **Immutable data:** Legal facts don't change—you create new states rather than modifying existing ones
3. **Composition:** Complex legal rules are built by combining simpler ones
4. **Type safety:** The computer prevents logical errors by checking that everything "fits together"

**Example transformation from procedural to functional thinking:**

**❌ Procedural mindset:**
```l4
-- "Step 1: Check if application complete"
-- "Step 2: Check if purposes charitable"
-- "Step 3: If both true, register charity"
```

**✅ Functional mindset:**
```l4
-- First define the types we need
DECLARE RegisterEntry
    HAS entryName IS A STRING
        entryPurposes IS A LIST OF Purpose
        entryGovernors IS A LIST OF Person
        entryConstitution IS A STRING
        entryIsActive IS A BOOLEAN

-- Define what completeness IS
GIVEN applicant IS A RegisterEntry
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
`constitution is written` MEANS NOT applicant's entryConstitution EQUALS ""

GIVEN applicant IS A RegisterEntry
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
`has at least one purpose` MEANS length (applicant's entryPurposes) > 0

GIVEN applicant IS A RegisterEntry
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
`has valid public benefit statement` MEANS TRUE  -- Simplified

GIVEN applicant IS A RegisterEntry
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
`application is complete` MEANS
    `constitution is written` applicant
    AND `has at least one purpose` applicant
    AND `has valid public benefit statement` applicant

-- Define what charitable purposes ARE
GIVEN charity IS A RegisterEntry
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
`all purposes are charitable` MEANS
    all (GIVEN p YIELD `is charitable purpose` p) (charity's entryPurposes)

-- Define registration criteria using the above
GIVEN applicant IS A RegisterEntry
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
`should register` MEANS
    `application is complete` applicant
    AND `all purposes are charitable` applicant
```

**Why this matters:** Legal reasoning is naturally functional—we define criteria and apply them, rather than executing procedures.

## **7.2 Function Application Precedence - The Critical Pattern**

**The most important syntax rule in L4:** Function application has higher precedence than field access.

**This causes systematic errors that look like this:**
```
unexpected 's
expecting &&, (, *, +, -, /, ;, <, <=, =, >, >=, AND, OR...
```

**Problem examples and solutions:**

**❌ Wrong - Parser confusion:**
```l4
-- length applicant's purposes > 0           -- Parser sees: (length applicant)'s purposes > 0
-- all (GIVEN p YIELD...) charity's purposes -- Parser sees: (all (GIVEN p YIELD...) charity)'s purposes
-- elem governor charity's governors         -- Parser sees: (elem governor charity)'s governors
```

**✅ Correct - Use parentheses:**
```l4
length (applicant's entryPurposes) > 0
all (GIVEN p YIELD `is charitable purpose` p) (charity's entryPurposes)
elem governor (charity's governors)
```

**The pattern:** When passing field access as function arguments, always wrap in parentheses.

**Why this happens:**
- L4 follows Haskell-like precedence: `function application > field access > comparison > boolean operators`
- `length applicant's purposes` is parsed as `(length applicant)'s purposes`
- The parser expects `length` to be applied to `applicant`, then tries to access `purposes` field of the result
- But `applicant` is not a list, so `length applicant` is a type error, and the parser gets confused

## **7.3 Field Access Patterns - Possessive vs Functional**

**L4 supports both possessive syntax and function application for field access.**

**When possessive syntax works:**
```l4
applicant's entryPurposes                    -- ✅ Fine in simple contexts
charity's entryConstitution                 -- ✅ Basic field access
governor's isGovernor                        -- ✅ Basic field access
```

**When you MUST use function application:**
```l4
-- In nested function calls (precedence issues)
-- ❌ length applicant's entryPurposes
-- ✅ length (applicant's entryPurposes)

-- In quantifier arguments
-- ❌ all (GIVEN p YIELD...) charity's entryPurposes
-- ✅ all (GIVEN p YIELD...) (charity's entryPurposes)
```

**Convert possessive to functional:**
- `object's field` → `field object`
- `object's field1's field2` → `field2 (field1 object)`

## **7.4 List Operations and Quantifiers**

**Key insight:** Use prelude functions instead of inventing syntax.

**❌ Non-existent syntax:**
```l4
-- EXISTS c IN list SUCH THAT condition    -- Not valid L4
-- EVERY x IS A Type WHERE condition       -- Not valid L4
-- FOR ALL x IN list CHECK condition       -- Not valid L4
```

**✅ Use prelude functions:**
```l4
-- For "exists" - use `any`
any (GIVEN c YIELD condition) list

-- For "all" - use `all`
all (GIVEN p YIELD condition) list

-- For "none" - use NOT and any
NOT any (GIVEN x YIELD condition) list

-- For filtering - use `filter`
filter (GIVEN x YIELD condition) list
```

**Pattern for quantified conditions:**
```l4
-- Template: quantifier (GIVEN variable YIELD condition) list

-- Example: "Some purpose is charitable"
any (GIVEN p YIELD `is charitable purpose` p) (charity's entryPurposes)

-- Example: "All purposes are charitable"
all (GIVEN p YIELD `is charitable purpose` p) (charity's entryPurposes)
```

## **7.5 Type Safety and Missing Functions**

**Problem:** L4's prelude is minimal—common functions may be missing.

**Systematic approach:**
1. **Check if function exists** in prelude (like `elem`, `filter`)
2. **Define missing functions** at the top of your file
3. **Use proper types** (don't mix STRING and LIST operations)

**Essential missing functions to define:**
```l4
-- List length (missing from prelude)
GIVEN a IS A TYPE
      list IS A LIST OF a
GIVETH A NUMBER
length list MEANS
  CONSIDER list
  WHEN EMPTY THEN 0
  WHEN x FOLLOWED BY xs THEN 1 + length xs
```

**Type checking patterns:**
```l4
-- ❌ Type error: mixing string and list operations
-- length someString > 0           -- length expects LIST, gets STRING

-- ✅ Correct: check string non-emptiness
NOT someString EQUALS ""        -- STRING comparison

-- ✅ Correct: check list non-emptiness
length (someList) > 0            -- LIST operation
```

## **7.6 Boolean Logic and Comparison Patterns**

**Prefer direct comparisons over negation:**

**❌ Unnecessarily complex:**
```l4
NOT c's isSpent EQUALS TRUE
NOT governor's isDisqualified EQUALS TRUE
```

**✅ Cleaner and clearer:**
```l4
c's isSpent EQUALS FALSE
governor's isDisqualified EQUALS FALSE
```

**Comparison precedence patterns:**
```l4
-- ✅ Simple comparisons work naturally
age >= 18
amount > 1000
date EQUALS today

-- ✅ Parentheses for complex expressions
(length purposes) > 0
(governor's age) >= minimumAge
(charity's income's amount) > threshold
```

**Boolean combination patterns:**
```l4
-- AND/OR precedence (AND binds tighter than OR)
condition1 AND condition2 OR condition3    -- Means: (condition1 AND condition2) OR condition3
condition1 OR condition2 AND condition3    -- Means: condition1 OR (condition2 AND condition3)

-- Use parentheses for clarity
(condition1 OR condition2) AND condition3
condition1 AND (condition2 OR condition3)
```

## **7.7 Systematic Debugging Approach**

**When you see syntax errors, follow this checklist:**

1. **Function precedence:** Are field accesses in function arguments wrapped in parentheses?
2. **Missing functions:** Is the function defined in prelude or your file?
3. **Type mismatches:** Are you using STRING operations on LISTs or vice versa?
4. **Possessive syntax:** Can you convert to function application form?
5. **Boolean logic:** Are comparisons and boolean operations correctly parenthesized?

**Error patterns and fixes:**
```
Error: "unexpected 's"
→ Fix: Add parentheses around field access in function arguments

Error: "could not find definition for LENGTH"
→ Fix: Define length function at top of file

Error: "expecting BOOLEAN, got STRING"
→ Fix: Use correct comparison (EQUALS "", not length > 0)

Error: "could not find definition for EXISTS"
→ Fix: Use any (GIVEN x YIELD condition) list
```

**Success Check:** You now understand L4's functional nature, can handle precedence correctly, use proper quantifiers, and systematically debug type and syntax errors.

# **Quick Reference**

## **Basic Syntax**
```l4
-- Comments start with --
IMPORT prelude                   -- Always start with this

-- Type definitions
DECLARE TypeName
    HAS field1 IS A Type1
        field2 IS A Type2

DECLARE EnumType IS ONE OF       -- Enumeration
    Option1
    Option2 HAS data IS A Type

-- Function definitions
GIVEN entity IS A Type           -- Input parameters
GIVETH A Type                    -- Return type
functionName MEANS expression    -- Function body

-- Contract definitions
GIVEN entity IS A Type
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
contractName MEANS
  PARTY Actor                    -- Who has the obligation
  MUST Action                    -- What they must do  
  WITHIN timeframe              -- Deadline (in days)
  HENCE FULFILLED               -- If they comply
  LEST FULFILLED                -- If they don't comply
```

## **Type Declarations**
```l4
-- Basic record type
DECLARE Person
    HAS name IS A STRING
        age IS A NUMBER
        isActive IS A BOOLEAN

-- Enumeration with data
DECLARE Purpose IS ONE OF
    `prevention or relief of poverty`
    `advancement of education`
    otherPurpose HAS description IS A STRING

-- Actor/Action types for contracts
DECLARE Actor IS ONE OF
    PersonActor HAS person IS A Person
    OrganizationActor HAS name IS A STRING

DECLARE Action IS ONE OF
    FileDocument HAS content IS A STRING
    PayAmount HAS amount IS A NUMBER
```

## **CONTRACT Syntax**
```l4
GIVEN entity IS A Type
GIVETH A CONTRACT Actor Action
`contract name` MEANS
  IF condition                   -- Optional condition
  THEN PARTY ActorType parameter -- Actor with obligation
       MUST ActionType parameter -- Action they must perform
       WITHIN days               -- Time limit in days
       HENCE FULFILLED           -- Success outcome
       LEST FULFILLED            -- Failure outcome
  ELSE FULFILLED                 -- Alternative when condition false
```

**Important:** 
- Always use proper Actor and Action constructors, not string literals
- Use simple parameters in MUST clauses - avoid complex object construction
- Parenthesize field access when used as function arguments: `length (entity's field)`

## **Value Creation**
```l4
-- Simple values
DECIDE constantName IS value

-- Constructor with parameters (match exact field count)
DECIDE entityName IS TypeName field1Value field2Value field3Value

-- List construction
DECIDE listName IS LIST item1, item2, item3
DECIDE emptyList IS LIST  -- Empty list of inferred type

-- Date construction  
DECIDE dateValue IS Date 2024 6 15  -- year month day
```

## **Common Patterns**
```l4
-- List operations (define length function first)
GIVEN a IS A TYPE
      list IS A LIST OF a
GIVETH A NUMBER
length list MEANS
  CONSIDER list
  WHEN EMPTY THEN 0
  WHEN x FOLLOWED BY xs THEN 1 + length xs

-- Boolean validation
GIVEN text IS A STRING
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
isNotEmpty MEANS NOT text EQUALS ""

-- List validation with quantifiers
GIVEN items IS A LIST OF Type
GIVETH A BOOLEAN
allValid MEANS all (GIVEN item YIELD condition) items

-- Field access in function arguments (always use parentheses)
length (entity's fieldName) > 0
elem item (entity's listField)
all (GIVEN x YIELD condition) (entity's items)
```

## **Essential Functions to Define**
```l4
-- Length function (not in prelude)
GIVEN a IS A TYPE
      list IS A LIST OF a
GIVETH A NUMBER
length list MEANS
  CONSIDER list
  WHEN EMPTY THEN 0
  WHEN x FOLLOWED BY xs THEN 1 + length xs
```
