1.  Key mechanisms in the Charities (Jersey) Law 2014

Mechanism	How it works	Where found
Statutory Charity Register	The Commissioner must keep a single register split into general, restricted and historic sections. It prescribes mandatory data-fields (name, number, constitution, governors, annual returns, enforcement notices, etc.) and a 10-year retention rule.	Art 8  ￼
Becoming a registered charity	Any entity that satisfies the charity test (only charitable purposes + public benefit) and has a Jersey nexus may apply. On acceptance the Commissioner allots a registration number and issues a certificate; refusal decisions are appealable.	Arts 5-7, 11  ￼
Restricted-section option	A charity that undertakes not to solicit donations from the public can elect to be shown only on the restricted section. The public record then discloses a reduced data-set.	Art 9 + Order 2018 (see below)
Keeping particulars up to date	Registered charities must notify every change in their governing or financial particulars and file an Annual Return every “return-year”. Failing to do so is a ground for enforcement.	Art 13  ￼
Governance & conduct duties	Governors owe fiduciary duties, must be fit and proper, and must report specified “disqualifying events” (bankruptcy, serious convictions, etc.).	Arts 18-20  ￼
Regulatory toolkit	The Commissioner may: demand information (Art 26); issue a Required Steps Notice ordering corrective action (Art 27); deregister a charity voluntarily (Art 15) or compulsorily (Art 16).	Arts 15-17, 26-27  ￼
Appeals	Aggrieved parties (and, in some cases, third parties) may appeal to the Charity Tribunal which can remit, vary or substitute the Commissioner’s decision—potentially with retrospective effect.	Arts 32-36 + Order 2020 (see below)
Criminal controls outside the Register	Unauthorised use of the words “charity”, misleading fundraising, obstruction of the Commissioner, breaches of confidentiality, etc., attract offences.	Arts 21-25, 28-31, 37  ￼

2.  What each subordinate Order adds or changes

Order (R&O No. / year)	Purpose & main effect	How it meshes with the 2014 Law
Charities (Timing of Annual Return) Order 2019 (R&O 144/2019)	Fixes the return-year as the 12-month period ending on the registration anniversary, unless the charity elects (once, within its first year) a different date. The Annual Return must reach the Commissioner within two months of that year-end.	Gives absolute filing deadlines and a predictable compliance calendar, tightening Art 13 oversight.  ￼
Charities (Additional Information) Order 2018 (R&O 59/2018)	Enriches the Register: every registration and Annual Return must now include core financial figures, totals of payments to governors, a public-benefit narrative, NPO flag, takeover flag, prior-deregistration flag, and an automatic “late” flag. It also defines connected person, core financial information and governor payment.	Deepens transparency without altering any trigger for registration or deregistration; the Commissioner simply populates extra columns once returns arrive.  ￼
Charities (Restricted Section of Register) Order 2018 (R&O 60/2018)	Spells out the “funding-condition” for restricted-section charities. They must not solicit donations from the public (broadly defined) and must actively avoid doing so; only connected persons and certain professionals may donate. Breach can justify refusal to restrict or future enforcement.	Gives practical teeth to the Art 9 election by turning it into an ongoing behavioural duty.  ￼
Charities (Appeals – Reasons & Time Limits) Order 2020 (R&O 102/2020)	Obliges the Commissioner to serve a written reasoned notice for key decisions (e.g., registration refusals, deregistration, Required Steps Notices) and sets strict windows: 28 days for applicants or registered charities, 56 days for third-party appellants. The Tribunal can admit late appeals “in the interests of justice”.	Standardises fairness and speed in Art 32-36 appeals but leaves the underlying Register untouched.  ￼
Charities (Reportable Matters) Order 2025 (R&O 27/2025)	Extends the list of events that governors, employees or trustees must report under Art 19 to the Commissioner: (i) any conviction—spent or unspent—for an offence against a vulnerable person; (ii) all other unspent convictions not already reportable. Defines “vulnerable person”.	Broadens the early-warning system that feeds the Commissioner’s powers to suspend governors, issue Required Steps Notices or deregister. No register field is added; the duty is to notify.  ￼

How the pieces fit together
	1.	The 2014 Law lays the architecture: a transparent public register, a clear charity test, compulsory annual reporting, and escalating regulatory powers (information demands → Required Steps Notice → suspension/deregistration → criminal prosecution).
	2.	The 2018–2019 Orders (Additional Information, Restricted Section, Timing of Annual Return) refine the input layer—what must be reported, when, and under what funding restraints—thereby enriching data quality and sharpening compliance timelines.
	3.	The 2020 Order tightens the output layer—how swiftly and transparently the Commissioner must explain decisions and how quickly they can be challenged.
	4.	The 2025 Order widens the risk-sensor layer by forcing charities to surface convictions that could compromise public trust or the safety of beneficiaries.
	5.	None of the Orders alters the core state-transition triggers (register, deregister, change of name, etc.); instead they supercharge the existing mechanisms—better data in, clearer process controls, and earlier warning signals—so the Commissioner can deploy the Law’s enforcement tools with greater speed and certainty.
