# From legislation to OpenFisca, via L4

**A readable, type-checked source layer that compiles to OpenFisca — so the
policy owner can validate the rules by eye, and the engine still runs in
OpenFisca.**

This document outlines the construct-by-construct correspondence between
[OpenFisca](https://openfisca.org) and [L4](https://github.com/legalese/l4-ide),
argues where the L4 *isomorphism* advances the state of the art, and walks a
toolchain that starts from legislation, passes through human-readable L4, and
transpiles to runnable OpenFisca — with the validating test outputs shown
end-to-end.

## 1. The toolchain

```
   ┌──────────────┐   isomorphic    ┌──────────────┐   l4 openfisca   ┌──────────────┐
   │ legislation  │  formalisation  │      L4      │  (this bridge)   │  OpenFisca   │
   │ / regulation │ ──────────────▶ │  .l4 source │ ───────────────▶ │   Python     │
   └──────────────┘                 └──────────────┘                  └──────────────┘
                                       │      ▲                          │
                            #EVAL /    │      │  human review            │  openfisca
                            #ASSERT     ▼      │  (no Python needed)      ▼  test / API
                                    ┌─────────────────┐            ┌─────────────────┐
                                    │  same numbers   │  ◀────────▶│  same numbers   │
                                    └─────────────────┘ conformance└─────────────────┘
```

The pivot is the middle column. Today, encoding legislation as OpenFisca means
writing **vectorised NumPy** directly — `condition * amount`, `where(...)`,
`household.sum(household.members(...))`. That is the right *execution* model, but
it is not something a policy owner, a lawyer, or a legislative drafter can read,
let alone validate against the statute they are responsible for.

L4 is designed to be that readable layer. The L4 source mirrors the **structure
of the legislation** (its conditions, thresholds, definitions, and cross-
references) using real Booleans, `IF/THEN/ELSE`, typed records, and named
helpers. The OpenFisca Python is then a *compilation artifact* — generated, not
hand-maintained — so the human-validated source and the executed model can never
drift.

**Why the policy owner cares:** they review the L4, not the Python. The L4 says
`IF (p's age >= 18) AND (p's salary EQUALS 0) THEN 600 ELSE 0`; the OpenFisca
says `np.where((person('age', period) >= 18) & (person('salary', period) == 0),
600, 0)`. Both compute the same thing; only one is reviewable by a non-
programmer.

## 2. Correspondence: OpenFisca ↔ L4

| OpenFisca | L4 | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `class X(Variable)` with a `formula` | `@export` … `GIVEN subject period … MEANS …` | a named computation over named inputs |
| `entity = Person` | the subject parameter's record type | subject's type *is* the entity |
| `definition_period = MONTH` | a conventional `period` parameter | threaded to the formula's `period` |
| `value_type = float / bool / str / int` | `GIVETH A NUMBER / BOOLEAN / STRING` | mapped by L4's type |
| input variable (no formula) | a stored record field / free scalar param | set by the caller |
| `person('salary', period)` | `p's salary` | field projection on the subject |
| `entity('other_var', period)` | a call to another `@export` decision | decisions reference each other |
| `+ - * /`, `< <= > >= ==` | same operators | vectorised numpy on the Python side |
| `&` / `\|` / `~` (numpy boolean) | `AND` / `OR` / `NOT` | L4 keeps real Booleans |
| `np.where(cond, t, e)` | `IF cond THEN t ELSE e` | the readable form of the "vectorial if" |
| **group entity** `build_entity(..., roles=[...])` | a record with `LIST OF Person` fields | each list field → a role |
| `household.members('x', period)` | `m's x` inside `map (GIVEN m YIELD …)` | member-array read |
| `household.sum(household.members('salary', period))` | `sum (map (GIVEN m YIELD m's salary) (h's members))` | aggregate over members |

Constructs the bridge does **not** yet compile (each is a clearly-scoped next
step, and all are already expressible in L4): legislation **parameter stores**
(`parameters(period).taxes.rate` + dated `formula_YYYY_MM`), **marginal-rate
scales** (recursion / fold), **enums** (`CONSIDER`), and the `count` / `any` /
`all` member aggregations beyond `sum`.

## 3. How the L4 isomorphism advances the state of the art

OpenFisca is excellent at *executing* tax-benefit logic at population scale. The
gap it leaves — and that L4 fills — is everything *upstream* of execution:

1. **Readability for the rule owner.** OpenFisca formulas are branch-free
   vectorised arithmetic by necessity. L4 keeps the legislative shape: real
   conditionals, named conditions (`is single`, `has child under 8`), typed
   records. The person accountable for the policy can read and sign off on the
   L4. The `condition * amount` idiom becomes a *lowering artifact* they never
   have to see.

2. **One source, validated two ways.** The same L4 file carries executable
   tests (`#EVAL`, `#ASSERT`). The bridge compiles it to OpenFisca, where the
   *same* scenarios run through `openfisca test` / the calculation API. When both
   produce the same numbers, the translation itself is validated — not assumed.
   (Every example below shows this round-trip.)

3. **Types and totality.** L4 is type-checked. A `salary` that should be a
   number, a `Household` that must have members, a decision that must return a
   Boolean — these are checked before anything runs, catching a class of errors
   that surface late (or never) in loosely-typed Python.

4. **Compile target, not lock-in.** Because the L4 is the source of truth and
   OpenFisca is a backend, the *same* L4 can target other backends (a consumer-
   facing web wizard, a documentation renderer, a formal-methods checker). The
   bridge makes OpenFisca one first-class destination among several, rather than
   the place the logic is trapped.

5. **Isomorphic to the statute.** L4's design goal is that the formal text lines
   up clause-for-clause with the legislation, so a reviewer can check the
   encoding against the source law. OpenFisca's structure is organised around the
   engine, not the statute; L4 lets you keep the statute's structure and *derive*
   the engine's.

None of this competes with OpenFisca — it complements it. OpenFisca remains the
runtime and the ecosystem (country packages, YAML tests, the web API). L4 becomes
the human-facing, type-checked, statute-aligned source that feeds it.

## 4. Worked examples (with validating outputs)

Each example is a real `.l4` file in this directory. `l4 openfisca FILE` emits
the OpenFisca module; the numbers below are produced by **running that emitted
module in OpenFisca** and confirming they match the L4 `#EVAL` values.

### 4.1 `flat-tax.l4` — the OpenFisca textbook example

L4:
```l4
GIVEN p IS A Person, period IS A STRING
GIVETH A NUMBER
`flat tax on salary` p period MEANS (p's salary) * 0.25
```
emits a `flat_tax_on_salary(Variable)` whose formula is
`person('salary', period) * 0.25`.

Round-trip: `salary = 2000 → flat_tax_on_salary = 500.0` ✓ (L4 `#EVAL`: 500).

### 4.2 `benefit.l4` — conditionals, Booleans, cross-decision calls

```l4
`eligible for benefit` h period MEANS
  (h's income) < 2000 AND (h's dependents) > 0

`monthly benefit` h period MEANS
  IF `eligible for benefit` h period
  THEN 500 + (h's dependents) * 100
  ELSE 0
```
`AND` → `&`, `< / >` → comparisons (fully parenthesised so numpy's operator
precedence is correct), `IF/THEN/ELSE` → `np.where`, and one decision reads
another via `household('eligible_for_benefit', period)`.

Round-trip: `eligible → True`, `monthly_benefit → 700.0` (income 1500, 2
dependents) and `0.0` (income 3000) ✓ — matching the L4 `#EVAL`s.

### 4.3 `household.l4` — group entity + `LIST OF` aggregation

```l4
DECLARE Household HAS members IS A LIST OF Person

`household income` h period MEANS
  sum (map (GIVEN m YIELD m's salary) (h's members))
```
`LIST OF Person` makes `Household` an OpenFisca **group entity** (with a member
role); the `sum (map …)` becomes
`household.sum(household.members('salary', period))`.

Round-trip: members earning 1000 and 1500 → `household_income = 2500.0` ✓
(L4 `#EVAL`: 2500).

## 5. Reproduce it

```sh
# emit
cabal run l4 -- openfisca jl4/examples/openfisca/household.l4 -o /tmp/household.py

# run it in real OpenFisca and check the numbers match the L4 #EVALs
uv venv --python 3.12 /tmp/of && uv pip install --python /tmp/of/bin/python openfisca-core "numpy==2.1.3"
/tmp/of/bin/python jl4/examples/openfisca/roundtrip_check.py /tmp/household.py household
```

The golden output of every example is pinned in `expected/` and checked by the
`l4 openfisca` cases in `jl4/tests-cli/Main.hs`.
