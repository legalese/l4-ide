# Day & Date Functions Reference

Daydate is a library with some basic functions to enable math with dates and days following ISO 8601.
Functions return datestamps (Number of days since 1st January 0000).
A week begins on Monday.

See examples or play around with it in our [online-editor](https://jl4.legalese.com/?id=6f9b3d0a-9afa-4c2d-9360-84a98e3bdb35).


### General use of the DATE type and constructing dates

The type DATE is used throughout the library. It is important to not directly use the uppercase DATE type constructor but to use the following syntax to create DATE objects safely and to make sure the date actually exists in the calendar.

```l4
IMPORT daydate

-- Safe ways to construct dates:
#EVAL August 12 2020          -- DATE OF 12, 8, 2020
#EVAL Date 2 July 2027        -- DATE OF 2, 7, 2027
#EVAL Month Jul 2027          -- DATE OF 1, 7, 2027
#EVAL Year 2027               -- DATE OF 1, 1, 2027
#EVAL Week 1 2027             -- DATE OF 4, 1, 2027
#EVAL Date 12 8 2020          -- DATE OF 12, 8, 2020
#EVAL Date 35 -2 2025         -- DATE OF 4, 11, 2024 - Calculates the days and months fore and backwards based on existing dates

-- DO NOT DO THIS! Unsafe ways to construct dates:
#EVAL Date Apr 1 2025         -- CAREFUL! This returns (DATE OF 4, 1, 2025) or 4th of January 2025 because Apr is used as the NUMBER 4 in this context!
#EVAL DATE 35 2 2025          -- CAREFUL! This returns (DATE OF 35, 2, 2025) because the DATE constructor does not apply the calendar. Always use Date!

-- When using dates in PROVISION statements behind the AT or WITHIN keywords, use the Day function to convert DATE objects to NUMBER (Days since 1st January 0000)
`A provision` MEANS
    PARTY   `The party`
    MUST    `act`
    WITHIN  Day (Apr 2 2026)

`The party` MEANS "Party name"    -- Boilerplate
`act`       MEANS "Do something"
```


Here are some example on how to use more advanced functions:

```l4
IMPORT daydate

#EVAL `is leap year` 2400                                 -- TRUE - Century divisible by 400
#EVAL Feb 29 2000 EQUALS (Date 29 2 2000)                 -- TRUE - leap day
#EVAL Week 53 2009 EQUALS Dec 28 2009                     -- TRUE - Last week of 53-week year
#EVAL Jan 1 2000 MINUS 1 EQUALS Dec 31 1999               -- TRUE - Subtraction across millennium
#EVAL `Weekday of 1st day of month` 3 2025 EQUALS Saturday-- TRUE - First day of month
#EVAL `the earlier of` (Feb 29 2024) (Feb 28 2024)        -- DATE OF 28, 2, 2024 - Earlier date in leap month
```

## Native Overloads

The library includes native operator overloads for DATE objects:

### Comparison Operators

- `__GEQ__` (>=): Compares if first date is greater than or equal to second

### Arithmetic Operators

- `__PLUS__`: Adds days to a DATE (DATE + NUMBER) or adds datestamps (DATE + DATE)
- `__MINUS__`: Subtracts days from a DATE (DATE - NUMBER) or subtracts datestamps (DATE - DATE)
- `__PLUS__`: Adds days to a datestamp (NUMBER + DATE)
- `__MINUS__`: Subtracts a DATE from a number (NUMBER - DATE)

These allow natural operations like:
```l4
Jan 1 2025 PLUS 30        -- Adds 30 days
Feb 1 2025 MINUS Jan 1 2025 -- Returns difference in days
Jan 1 2025 GREATER THAN Dec 31 2024 -- Returns TRUE
