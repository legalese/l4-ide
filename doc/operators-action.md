# Action Operators

Most actions are user-defined. These are a few special actions that ship with L4.

## Dynamic regulatives: Empower / Disempower

Example: a legislative assembly has the power to revise a constitution to invest a head of state with the power to invest a police officer with the power of arrest.

Activation or inactivation of a new regulative rule. Typically used as a Hohfeldian override of an existing right/no-right.

See [regulative-powers.l4](../jl4/experiments/regulative-powers.l4)

## Goal-Directed Agency: Procure / Encourage

Example: a parent corporation agrees to procure that its subsidiary will do such and such.

(see-to-it-that "stit" operator according to Belnap and DL-PC)

"encourage" is a softer form: if, despite best efforts, through no fault of the actor, the goal is unmet, then "encourage" holds. But the actor must have tried in good faith. Strategy logic will verify this -- MCMAS and UPPAAL-TIGA could work.

## Epistemics: Notify / Announce / Publish

Notify to specified parties.

Announce to all parties.

Publish could be to a newspaper ad: "I hereby apologize unreservedly ..."
