# L4 - Rules as Code - Summary

L4 is a specialized programming language designed for formalizing legal documents, including legislation, regulations, and contracts. It combines software engineering principles with legal drafting to create clear, unambiguous rules that can be automatically processed and verified.

Key features include:

- Boolean logic for clear yes/no decisions
- Data modeling with records and types
- Ternary logic for handling unknown values
- Default values and logic for common assumptions
- First-order predicate logic for constitutive rules
- Support for temporal reasoning and deontic logic

L4 enables:

- Automated visualization of decision logic
- Generation of interactive web wizards
- Creation of reasoner backends with explanation traces
- Formal verification of legal rules

The language is particularly suited for insurance policies, rental leases, employment agreements, and financial contracts where precise rule interpretation is critical.
