# README

This is initial attempt at a 'chatbot'. But as the name of this project suggests,
this isn't quite a chatbot in the usual sense --- it's really more a 'semantic parser' that parses unstructured, natural language to a structured function call /structured query, and that, in the future, will do more interesting (but still more-constrained-than-the-usual-chatbot) things with that output.
